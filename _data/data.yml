experiences:
    - role: Lead Backend Engineer
      time: 2023 - Present
      company: Night District LLC
      details: |
        Initially I was brought on as a fullstack consultant to advise the startup's
        small development team during a tumultuous infrastructure migration.
        I helped improve the teams forward security posture, hardenned their nginx server,
        setup monitoring, and by introducing various best practices
        such as public key based authentication and
        sercrets management for 3rd party service accounts
        registered to the project (as well as environmental secrets).
        After discovering numerous vulnerabilities left behind by
        former contractors, I was able to provide critical analysis
        that enabled an actionable response strategy for the team as well
        as the project's stakeholders.
        Shortly thereafter, in December of 2023, I was offered to join the
        company as lead back engineer (and briefly held the role of acting C.T.O.)
        Since then, I have been one of the primary contributers across the following projects iwthin the company:
        - rewritting the network stack - moving away from websockets to a rest API, (which we are currenty rewriting in Rails),
        - dockerizing the backend api server and reconfiguring nginx to support load balancing and kubernetes integration,
        - restructuring and migrating MongoDB database clusters,
        - refactoring two legacy frontend codebases (Flutter and ReactJS, respectively),
        - optized various schema used by the above in addition to the
          project's set of multiplatform e-commerce mobile applications
          and the company's internal management panel.
    - role: Pitmaster (Production Manager)
      time: Feb 2016 – April 2018
      company: Bourbon Barrel Foods LLC
      details: |
        I was a key-holder, managed purchase orders, and was responsible
        for all hiring and training in my department. I maintained production
        logs and other required documentation and acted as liason during audits.
        Additionally, I pursued numerous pet-projects within the company that
        proved to be successful.
        - I augmented our mandated pen-and-paper logging workflow with digitally
          tracked raw material quantities, usage rates, and other metrics
          which until then had gone untracked. Collating these data afforded
          new analytical insights that allowed my department to provide
          clients with more accurate fufillment dates and also helped
          to decongest our shipping/receiving department.
        - I devised and implemented a novel "relational" production strategy
          which increased my team's agility and measurably improved our efficieny.
        - I was passionate about collaborating with other local businesses.
          To that end, I facilitated a customizable product ordering process
          which involved estimating individual concepts' material needs,
          providing consultation, and at times personally advocating on
          their behalf when special accomodations became necessary.
