experiences:
    - role: Chief Technology Officer
      time: 2023 - Present
      company: Night District LLC
      details: |
        I was originally brought on as a fullstack consultant to assist the startup's
        small team of developers during a tumultuous infrastructure migration.
        I helped improve the teams forward security posture through standard
        server hardenning techinques and by introducing various best practices
        into the team's workflow such as public key based authentication and
        sercrets management for the numerous 3rd party service accounts
        registered to the project.
        The team and I discovered numerous vulnerabilities left behind by
        former contractors, of which I was able to provide critical analysis
        that enabled an actionable response strategy for stakeholders.
        Shortly thereafter, in December of 2023, I was offered to join the
        company and to assume the role of acting CTO.
        Since then, I have made significant contributions across the
        project's (MERN) software stack, including
        - restructuring and migrating MongoDB database clusters,
        - refactoring the frontend ReactJS codebase,
        - refactoring the nodejs backend API server,
        - optized various schema used by the above in addition to the
          project's set of multiplatform e-commerce mobile applications
          as well as the company's internal management panel.
    - role: Pitmaster (Production Manager)
      time: Feb 2016 – April 2018
      company: Bourbon Barrel Foods LLC
      details: |
        I was a key-holder, managed purchase orders, and was responsible
        for all hiring and training in my department. I maintained production
        logs and other required documentation and acted as liason during audits.
        Additionally, I pursued numerous pet-projects within the company that
        proved to be successful.
        - I augmented our mandated pen-and-paper logging workflow with digitally
          tracked raw material quantities, usage rates, and other metrics
          which until then had gone untracked. Collating these data afforded
          new analytical insights that allowed my department to provide
          clients with more accurate fufillment dates and also helped
          to decongest our shipping/receiving department.
        - I devised and implemented a novel "relational" production strategy
          which increased my team's agility and measurably improved our efficieny.
        - I was passionate about collaborating with other local businesses.
          To that end, I facilitated a customizable product ordering process
          which involved estimating individual concepts' material needs,
          providing consultation, and at times personally advocating on
          their behalf when special accomodations became necessary.
